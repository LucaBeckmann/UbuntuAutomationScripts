Hello!

This repository contains (or will contain) a few scripts that help me automate tasks in my homelab environment.  
I know there are more advanced and scalable ways to do this, but until I figure those out, I’ll be using these scripts. :)

Feel free to clone and adapt them to your own environment.  
⚠️ I take no responsibility if they break something on your system!  
Please don’t just run code from the internet — make sure you understand what it does first.

If you have any suggestions or improvements, just create a pull request.

Have fun!
